## 🚀 System Design Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository documenting my learning journey in **System Design**. This initiative is part of a structured effort to build scalable thinking, enhance architectural proficiency, and cultivate a systems-level understanding of distributed technologies.

## 📌 Objective
The primary objective of this repository is to:
- Chronicle my progress as I explore key system design concepts.
- Capture learnings, insights, and technical breakdowns derived from high-quality educational content.
- Create a comprehensive knowledge base that can serve as a future reference or learning tool.

## 🎓 Learning Resource
The insights and notes shared here are curated from the [**Jordan Has No Life**]() YouTube channel, which provides a pragmatic and well-articulated series on system design fundamentals and real-world architecture scenarios.
