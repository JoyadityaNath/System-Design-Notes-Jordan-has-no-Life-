# System-Design-Notes
## 🚀 System Design Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository documenting my learning journey in **System Design**. This initiative is part of a structured effort to build scalable thinking, enhance architectural proficiency, and cultivate a systems-level understanding of distributed technologies.

## 📌 Objective
The primary objective of this repository is to:
- Chronicle my progress as I explore key system design concepts.
- Capture learnings, insights, and technical breakdowns derived from high-quality educational content.
- Create a comprehensive knowledge base that can serve as a future reference or learning tool.

## 🎓 Learning Resource
The insights and notes shared here are curated from the [**Jordan Has No Life**](https://www.youtube.com/@jordanhasnolife5163/playlists) YouTube channel, which provides a pragmatic and well-articulated series on system design fundamentals and real-world architecture scenarios.

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `notes/` — Contains structured markdown notes organized by topic/episode.
-  `diagrams/` — (Optional) Visual aids and architectural diagrams.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Context

While this journey is primarily theoretical, contextual implementations may reference:
- Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP)
- Load balancing and caching mechanisms
- Microservices and container orchestration
- Databases (SQL/NoSQL)
- Message queues and event-driven systems

## ✅ Commit to Consistency

This is an ongoing effort, and new content will be added incrementally. Feedback, collaboration, or suggestions are always welcome!

## 📝 About the Notes

The original notes documented in this repository were taken in a highly concise format while watching the **System Design 2.0** series by *Jordan Has No Life*. 
To enhance clarity, depth, and educational value, the notes have been **elaborated and formalized** using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, ensuring:
- Conceptual completeness without compromising simplicity.
- Professional formatting and terminology.
- Better alignment with scalable system design best practices.

These elaborations are intended to support personal learning and are not direct transcripts of the source content.
