#  1. What is Systems Design?

This section captures key insights from the first video in the *System Design* series by **Jordan Has No Life**, focusing on data storage fundamentals and the motivation for using dedicated data storage systems in scalable architectures.

## ðŸ”¸ Types of Storage

### 1. **HDD/SSD (Persistent Storage)**
- Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid State Drives (SSDs) are **persistent** forms of storage.
- Data remains intact until explicitly deleted or the hardware fails.
- Ideal for storing application-critical data that needs to persist beyond program execution or system reboots.


### 2. **RAM (Volatile Storage)**
- Random Access Memory (RAM) is **temporary** and volatile.
- Data stored in RAM is erased when the system is powered off or restarted.
- Suitable for short-term, high-speed data access during computation but **not viable** for long-term storage.
